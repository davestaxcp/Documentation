By the Board of Directors, if the conflict of interest transaction receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the Board or committee who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction. However, a conflict of interest transaction may not be so authorized, approved, or ratified by a single director. If a majority of the directors with no direct or indirect interest in the transaction votes to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking such action. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of the authorization, approval, or ratification, if the transaction is otherwise approved as permitted by law.</li><li>(ii) By Members. By the members of the Corporation if the conflict of interest transaction receives a majority of the votes entitled to be counted. Votes cast by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction may be counted in such a vote to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interest transaction. A majority of the members, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking such action.</li></ul><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="section-516-resignation-and-removal"></a>Section 5.16 Resignation and Removal:<a class="hash-link" href="#section-516-resignation-and-removal" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>(a) Resignation.
